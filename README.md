# 👋 Hey, I’m Minahil

I’m deep into building software, automation, and AI-driven solutions.
Right now I’m focused on leveling up across backend engineering, machine learning, cloud, and cybersecurity — and shipping projects that actually solve problems.

🚀 What I Do

Build automation tools (browser, system, workflow)

Create AI/ML models for real datasets

Develop full-stack apps & APIs

Explore cloud-native tech (Docker, K8s, AWS, Azure)

Experiment with security research & ethical hacking concepts

I’m always working on something new — usually a mix of AI, automation, and high-impact tools.
